# Twitch Global BlackList
> A blacklist collection which is global usage to ban/kick/block someone who is offensive towards streams.

## How to use it?
Basically we had separated those targeted users into categories:

 - [ ] bots
 - Examples: Nightbot, Streamlabs, Streamelements, Moobot, etc
 - Those are your helping friends which used to help you monitoring your stream, interactive with chatters and etc.
 - Normally you don't have to blacklist them, meanwhile you can either hide their chat in your stream overlay and block them from earning currency.
 - [ ] lurkers
 - Examples: electricallongboard, twitchdetails, commanderroot, bingcortana, etc
 - Those guys are doing nothing, even cause no effect on your view count, but just to stay in your chat and lurking.
 - The problem of their lurking are they are ruining your economy/currency/loyalty point system as they are lurking longer than every average viewer and that will discourage them keep earning currency from your stream.
 - You don't have to blacklist them, but please kindly block their earning currency feature (streamelements can do that)
 - We had moved the list into this particular website https://twitchinsights.net/bots for complete version. Search the user you suspet and check if he is lurker!
 - [ ] advertisers
 - Examples: UnderratedTwitchers, communityshowcase, shoutgamers, etc
 - Those "organization" claims that they will help you advertise/host your stream to aid you getting viewers.
 - Meanwhile, they are in gray zone between advertise and lurkers.
 - Been tried 3 years experiment and I concluded that their aid are almost 0.
 - Feel free to block them or if you really want to see if they can somehow help you, leave them alone.
 - [ ] offensive: ad hominem & name calling
 - Examples: "your mom fat", "you're ugly", "you are nothing but shit in stream", etc.
 - Self explain what it does.
 - [ ] offensive: 战对岸
 - 通常发生在中文频道区 会有一些无脑的用户盲目洗频宣誓台湾与中国的关系 都会归类在这里
 - [ ] offensive: 18+
 - Sexual comment lover, 18+ jokes holder, anything about offensive sex attacks belong here. 
 - [ ] offensive:others
 - minority of them, special cases, or not too many so we can put into.
