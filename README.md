# Twitch Blacklist Directory
A blacklist collection which is global usage to ban/kick/block someone who is offensive towards streams.


## How to use it?
Basically we had separated those targeted users into categories:
1. bots
-> you don't have to blacklist them, but you can either make their chat ignore in overlay or block them from earning currency
2. lurkers
-> handpicked lurkers as they didn't increase your view count thus ruining your currency. Kinda block them from earning your streaming currency.
3. advertisers
-> this list is a bit special, they are somewhere between lurkers and "hosters" which claimed to "help increase your views by hosting". As far as I had experimented for 3 years, their help are basically nothing but more like lurkers. Feel free to block them or if you really want to see if they can somehow help you, leave them.
4. Offensive
-> this one have few sub-categories:
  - Swear word lover
  -> as title said, a person who says nothing but swearing at you, your mother, etc.
  - 战对岸
  -> 通常发生在中文频道区 会有一些无脑的用户盲目洗频宣誓台湾与中国的关系 都会归类在这里
  - 18+
  -> sexual comment lover, 18+ jokes holder, anything about offensive sex attacks belong here.
  - others
  -> minority of them, special cases, or not too many so we can put into.
5. Common bad words/swear
-> flexible. Don't mindless copy all of them as it will make your stream Utopia.
